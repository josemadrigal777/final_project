    <p> So I started going for Chelsea two to three years ogo. They were doing really bad.
      They were around 15th place when I started to go for them. They ended up
      in 10th place at the end of the season.
      The reason I started goimg for them was beacuse of the squad that they had.
      And now they are in 1st place. I also went to go see them play at the
      Rosebowl against Liverpool last year in the summer. They won 1-0 with a header. This is why I like them.</p>
