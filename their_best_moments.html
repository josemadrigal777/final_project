    <p>Throughout Chelsea's history there have been a lot of good and bad moments.
    But these are some of their best moments. One of the best moments was when
    they signed Frank Lampard to the team. Frank Lampard ended up being the top
    goal scorer in the Premier League of all times. Also, in 2012, Chelsea won
    their first ever Champions League. Another huge important moment in their
    carrer was in 1969 when they won their first F.A. Cup.</p>
